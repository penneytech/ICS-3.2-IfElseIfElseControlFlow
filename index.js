/*
You are creating a typing practice app that rates the speed someone can type at. This app will display a message based on the speed. Typically a rate of 90 words per minute is fast, 70 words per minute is average, and 50 and under is slow. 

1) Declare a variable for the typing speed.
2) Create an if / else if / else control flow statement that satisfies the following requirements:
    a) Displays one of three messages based on the typing speed.
    b) The message content should reflect the user achievement based on the speed.
    c) Set the initial value of the variable you declared to trigger the 'middle' range of achievement.
